<!--
Initially files are uploaded into a temporary directory and 
then relocated to a target destination by a PHP script.

Information in the phpinfo.php page describes the temporary 
directory that is used for file uploads as upload_tmp_dir and 
the maximum permitted size of files that can be uploaded is
stated as upload_max_filesize. These parameters are set into 
PHP configuration file php.ini

The process of uploading a file follows these steps âˆ’

1. The user opens the page containing a HTML form featuring a text files,
 a browse button and a submit button.

2. The user clicks the browse button and selects a file to upload from the local PC.

3. The full path to the selected file appears in the text filed then the 
user clicks the submit button.

4. The selected file is sent to the temporary directory on the server.

5. The PHP script that was specified as the form handler in the form's 
action attribute checks that the file has arrived and then copies the 
file into an intended directory.

6. The PHP script confirms the success to the user.

As usual when writing files it is necessary for both temporary and 
final locations to have permissions set that enable file writing. 
If either is set to be read-only then process will fail.

An uploaded file could be a text file or image file or any document.

<!--
When submitting a form, you tell your browser to send, via the HTTP protocol,
 a message on the network, properly enveloped in a TCP/IP protocol message structure.
 An HTML page has a way to send data to the server: by using <form>s.

When a form is submitted, an HTTP Request if created and sent to the server, 
the message will contain the field names in the form and the values filled 
in by the user. This transmission can happen with POST or GET HTTP methods.

POST tells your browser to build an HTTP message and put all content in the 
body of the message (a very useful way of doing things, more safe and also flexible).
GET will submit the form data in the querystring. It has some constraints
 about data representation and length.
 
Stating how to send your form to the server:
Attribute enctype has sense only when using POST method. When specified,
 it instructs the browser to send the form by encoding its content in a
 specific way. From MDN - Form enctype:

When the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME 
type of content that is used to submit the form to the server.

application/x-www-form-urlencoded: This is the default. When the form is sent, 
all names and values are collected and URL Encoding is performed on the final string.

multipart/form-data: Characters are NOT encoded. This is important when the 
form has a file upload control. You want to send the file binary and this 
ensures that bitstream is not altered.

text/plain: Spaces get converted, but no more encoding is performed.

What Is the PHP $_FILES, and How to Use $_FILES


Sometimes we want to upload a file in our HTML form. 
PHP provides the feature for handling a file at server
 side with $_FILES array. We can also check different 
 properties of an files like file-name, file-type, file-size,
 and some other attributes.

 
	
 
What is $_FILES?
PHP provides one global variable called $_FILES.
 It is a two-dimensional associative array that keeps 
 information related to uploaded files via the HTTP POST method.

It holds attribute as follows:

Attribute	Description
[name]	    Name of the file being uploaded
[size]	    Size of the file
[type]     	Type of file
[tmp_name]	Temporary address where the file is located before processing the upload request
[error]	    Error code associated with the file
Above attributes syntax with $_FILES.

$_FILES[file][name]
$_FILES[file][tmp_name]
$_FILES[file][type]
$_FILES[file][size]
$_FILES[file][error]
